First, we import the moviepy library, which is a Python library for video editing and manipulation.
We create an instance of the VideoFileClip class, passing the path to the video file ("1.mp4") as an argument. This loads the video file into memory.
We extract the audio from the video file using the audio attribute of the VideoFileClip instance. This returns an audio clip object.
Finally, we write the extracted audio to a new file using the write_audiofile method. We specify the output file name as "audio_extracted.mp3".
This code extracts the audio from the video file and saves it as an MP3 file. The moviepy library provides a wide range of functionalities for video editing and manipulation, including audio extraction, video trimming, and more.
